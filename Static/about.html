		<h2>Overview</h2>
		The magician's secret of machine learning is the quality of dataset really determines the 
		quality of results. For this task, I wanted to build a clothing style classifier by decade.
		I could not find an existing dataset labeling attire style by decade, so I had to build one manually from 
		google images. Once this tedious process was complete, I could use transfer learning on a pre-trained
		deep-learning model to build my classier. <p></p>
        
    <h3>Data Collection</h3>
		I could not simply pull all the results from a search query because there was too much variation 
		across image types. I needed relatively standardized images, individuals with a full outfit with 
		minimal background. The more variation in the images the more challenging the learning task and 
		ultimately more images required. I went with quality over quantity approached manually building a 
		dataset containing 100 images per category. Because of the lack of quality images, I restricted 
		the images to woman's attire and combined decades. There were simply far more results for women 
		than men and even then I felt I would not have images per decade, so I combined what I felt were similar 
		decades together. To further combat the lack of data, I augmented existing data by applying a 
		horizontal flips.<p></p>

    <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
    Data was the limiting factor in building this application, but there was still some doing on the ML front.
    The only way to build an image classifier without tens of thousands of images is through transfer learning. 
    Transfer learning takes a pre-trained model and replaces the final classification layers. Selecting the pre-trained
		model and structure of the final layers are hyperparameters to optimize on. In this case, I selected 
		the VGG16 model with final layes of flatten, dropout(.75) and finally a dense layer (5, activation=softmax). 
		The dropout layer was added to combat model overfitting. My selection process was manual, but there advanced methods of 
		Bayesian optimization and genetic algorithms to perform a more robust hyperparameter search. In this case, I doubt 
		such methods would be fruitful because there is a cap on performance given the available data.<p></p>

    <h3>Results</h3>
		The model achieved a categorical accuracy of 73% on the validation set. Accuracy is an appropriate 
		performance metric since the categories were balanced.<p></p>
    
        
    <h2>Future Work</h2>
		Other than building a larger dataset, a better model could be built by focusing on specific elements 
		of clothing and classifying on styles associated with a given decade. For, example focusing on pant 
		legs and identifying bell bottoms for the 70s. With enough data, an ML algorithm would learn this on 
		its own, but with directed training better result can be achieved with fewer images. Training a model 
		to identify pant legs and collars etc. is not trivial, but a lot of work has been in this area that I 
		can build from, see DeepFasion. <p></p>

    The same method to classify styles by decades can be used for other types of categories, like sub-cultures of 
    hippie, punk, etc. or formality like semi-formal, business-casual, etc.
